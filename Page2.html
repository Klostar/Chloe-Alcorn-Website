<p> This was a work out that used a 100kg tyre. Pair up with sumo deadlifts for a
  killer whole body workout</p>

<p> The difference in definition form a year ago till now is what I am most impressed with.
   I especially notice it on my back </p>



<h4> My Goals </h4>
<p>my goal is to be healthy. Whatever I manage to push myself to do, is something I coudnt do a year
ago and thats what pushes me forward. I couldn't do 1 push up back then, now I can do 100 +. Although, I would
like to compete one day, but right now, I am happy training, trying to lift heavy and be the best I can be. </p>
