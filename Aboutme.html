<h2> Exercise </h2>
<p1> I really love exercising. My second home is the gym and thats
  not even a joke. I spend roughly 6 days a week training I have recently participated
  in the 1000 burpee challenge to raise money for POD childrens Charity along with some of
  my friends. It took us a total of 2 hours 40 minutes

<p2> I do a lot of different types of training. My favourite is weight training.
  In 1 year I have managed to improve my Personal Records dramatically.
